Show your venue’s opening hours, holidays and special openings to your blog’s visitors.

== Description ==

This Plugin gives you the opportunity to set up your venue’s opening hours, holidays and special openings (for example Christmas days) and offers you many ways to show them to your site’s visitors:
* Opening Hours Overview Widget: This Widget lists up all opening hours in a table
* Opening Hours Status Widget: This Widget displays a red resp. green message depending on wether your venue is currently open or not
* Opening Hours [is-open] Shortcode: This Shortcode displays a custom message wether your venue is currently open or closed right in your post- or page-content
* Opening Hours is_open() Template Tag: returns a true/false depending on wether your venue is open or closed
* Opening Hours Holiday Widget: This Widget lists up all your Holidays
* Opening Hours Special Openings Widget: This Widget lists up all your special openings.

The regular opening hours, holidays and special openings are taken into consideration when calculating wether your venue is open or not
